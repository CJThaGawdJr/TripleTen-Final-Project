Final Project Feedback from Professor at TripleTen

Hi Carl, thank you for these updates and congratulations on finishing! Please see detailed feedback below:

Dashboard Storytelling & Relevance ✅ Strengths:
The Tableau dashboard and supporting slides tell a focused story: which city, cuisine, and season are best for launching a new restaurant.

Visuals like sales vs. city, sales vs. cuisine, and sales seasonality are all tightly aligned with this goal.

Key cities like Tirupati and cuisines like North Indian and Chinese are backed by visual evidence.

🔧 Minor Suggestions:

Consider labeling chart axes more cleanly and adding brief annotations directly onto the visuals for context.

Findings & Report Format ✅ Strengths:
The Google Slides-style report is well-structured with a clear agenda and step-by-step breakdown.

Key findings are summarized in plain language and matched with visuals.

Strong callouts and data-backed decisions (e.g., Electronic City vs. Tirupati) demonstrate analytical depth.

Conclusions & Recommendations ✅ Strengths:
Carl provides clear and actionable recommendations:

Open in Tirupati in October

Focus on North Indian or Chinese cuisines

Avoid launching in the summer slump

The insights are directly linked to data trends—this is business intelligence at its core.

Tool Usage & Dashboard Presentation ✅ Tableau Used Effectively:
The dashboard demonstrates competency in aggregating and presenting segmented data.

The visuals are simple and digestible, appropriate for business stakeholders.

🔧 Minor Areas for Improvement:

The dashboard could benefit from slightly tighter layout formatting.

Some redundant slide text (e.g., “Cuisine Insights pt. 1 and pt. 2”) could be merged for polish.

📘 Final Feedback:
Carl, this is a very strong and clearly structured business analytics project. You’ve demonstrated the ability to not only surface useful insights, but also recommend smart, actionable strategies around location, cuisine, and timing—exactly what a decision-maker at Zomato would need.
